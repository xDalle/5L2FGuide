				<h2>Scope Overview</h2>
				<p>This section focuses on the complexity of privacy between different aspects of data protection. One must be absolute about the territorial, material, and personal scope of this aspect-or else one organization finds themselves compliant while another doesn't, and individuals also might not know where or how to claim their rights.<br>This section explores two relevant concepts in the personal scope context: <strong>opt-in</strong> consent mandates every participant to knowingly agree to the construction or processing of his/her data. Such terms endorse user control and emphasize data privacy.
					In contrast, <strong>opt-out</strong> consent enables organizations to carry out the personal data collection and processing by default. An individual's option is to refuse or withdraw such consent.</p>

				<li class="scope-title"><strong>Personal Scope</strong>
					<ul>
						<li class="item-title"><strong>LGPD:</strong>
							<li class="item-title2">Consent: opt-in</li>
							<li class="item-title2">Focus: data protection</li>
							<li class="item-title2">Summary: the LGPD requires that organizations obtain the express consent of individuals before processing their personal information. The law endorses the right of individuals to protect their personal information by giving them control of their data.</li>
						</li>
						<li class="item-title"><strong>GDPR:</strong>
							<li class="item-title2">Consent: opt-in</li>
							<li class="item-title2">Focus: data protection (broadest scope)</li>
							<li class="item-title2">Summary: The GDPR adopts an opt-in model, placing extra weight on data protection. It is well-rounded: a wide array of personal data is concerned. It specifically forbids allowing children under 16 years of age to consent without parental approval, so the vulnerable community is more protected through the compliance program.</li>
						</li>
						<li class="item-title"><strong>ADPPA:</strong>
							<li class="item-title2">Consent: opt-out</li>
							<li class="item-title2">Focus: corporate freedom</li>
							<li class="item-title2">Summary: The ADPPA adopts an opt-out framework, that is, a system allowing the processing of personal data by organizations unless individuals otherwise choose to opt out. This framework favors business interests over individual privacy rights and, therefore, heightens the fear of risks against personal data.</li>
						</li>
						<li class="item-title"><strong>Australian Privacy Act:</strong>
							<li class="item-title2">Consent: opt-in</li>
							<li class="item-title2">Focus: data protection (narrower scope)</li>
							<li class="item-title2">Summary: The Australian Privacy Act employs an opt-in approach but has a more limited application in data protection. It does not recognize a difference between the obligations for data controllers and processors, potentially giving rise to ambiguity in accountability. It doesn't restrict children from providing consent, exposing minors to risks.</li>
						</li>
						<li class="item-title"><strong>CCPA:</strong>
							<li class="item-title2">Consent: opt-out</li>
							<li class="item-title2">Focus: corporate freedom</li>
							<li class="item-title2">Summary: The CCPA utilizes an opt-out model, which consumers can opt out of having their data sold. Interestingly, it allows consent from an individual child above the age of 13. In a way, it allows minors to have some control over their personal data. </li>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="scope-title"><strong>Territorial Scope</strong>
					<ul>
						<li class="item-title"><strong>LGPD:</strong>
							<li class="item-title2">Applies to organizations both within Brazil and internationally, as long as they process personal data of Brazilian residents. This enormous scope of jurisdiction ensures that any institution interested in the processing of personal data of Brazilian residents has to comply with its provisions, irrespective of where the institution is located.</li>
						</li>
						<li class="item-title"><strong>GDPR:</strong>
							<li class="item-title2">Applies to any organization within the EU as well as those outside the EU that process personal data of individuals residing in the EU. The cross-jurisdictional application highlights the need for protection in the data domain from multiple borders.</li>
						</li>
						<li class="item-title"><strong>ADPPA:</strong>
							<li class="item-title2">Applies directly to data processing activities pertaining to persons residing within the United States, making its jurisdiction slightly more localized relative to the LGPD and GDPR</li>
						</li>
						<li class="item-title"><strong>Australian Privacy Act:</strong>
							<li class="item-title2">Applies to APP (Australian Privacy Principles) entities, which can be located both within and outside Australia, as long as they collect or handle personal data from Australian residents.</li>
						</li>
						<li class="item-title"><strong>CCPA:</strong>
							<li class="item-title2">Applies specifically to for-profit companies operating in California with annual revenues exceeding $25 million that handle personal data. This law establishes a specific criterion for applicability, focusing on the scale of operations.</li>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="scope-title"><strong>Material Scope</strong>
					<ul>
						<li class="item-title"><strong>LGPD:</strong>
							<li class="item-title2">Includes sensitive personal data, which is directly associated with identifiable individuals. This extends to any data that can be linked to a person, thereby ensuring comprehensive protection of personal information.</li>
						</li>
						<li class="item-title"><strong>GDPR:</strong>
							<li class="item-title2">Includes sensitive personal data, which can include both direct and indirect associations. Notably, it includes personal data of employees, emphasizing the protection of sensitive information in various contexts, including employment.</li>
						</li>
						<li class="item-title"><strong>ADPPA:</strong>
							<li class="item-title2">Includes sensitive personal data, but does not specifically cover employees' personal data, focusing more on consumer data protection.</li>
						</li>
						<li class="item-title"><strong>Australian Privacy Act:</strong>
							<li class="item-title2">Includes sensitive personal data, which is defined broadly to encompass various types of personal information. However, it does not specifically include employees' personal data, reflecting a different approach to workplace privacy, but it uniquely considers opinions as personal data.</li>
						</li>
						<li class="item-title"><strong>CCPA:</strong>
							<li class="item-title2">Includes sensitive personal data, however, similar to the ADPPA, it does not explicitly cover employees' personal data.</li>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
