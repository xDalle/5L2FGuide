            "<strong>General Data Protection Law (LGPD)</strong><br><br>The Brazilian regulation that elucidates the duty of adequate treatment of personal data by controllers, given the conditions, is the LGPD. In effect since August 2020, the law seeks to ensure, within its territorial scope of application, the integrity of data privacy for the entire Brazilian population, even if processing is not carried out in national territory, as long as the collection occurs. It is worth noting that, based on the European GDPR regulation, the law was established to prevent new data breaches, given that previous Brazilian laws related to data processing did not succeed in fully ensuring the protection of personal data, including in the area of software development.",
            "<strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong><br><br>The GDPR arises from the need to prevent the increasing violation of personal data in the digital age, given the abrupt change in the context of privacy. Moreover, in force since May 2018, the regulation establishes a series of rules aimed at protecting the data of citizens residing in the European Union (EU) to prevent such data breaches. Furthermore, the GDPR is not limited to data processing within the EU territory but applies to any activity related to personal data as long as it belongs to residents, regardless of the country of origin where it is processed, with the application of administrative sanctions in case of violations.",
            "<strong>American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADPPA)</strong><br><br>Regarding the United States of America (USA), the embryonic ADPPA was introduced in July 2022 as the first comprehensive data privacy bill in the country. Before the ADPPA, each state had the autonomy to designate privacy frameworks to be followed and state legislations, such as the California data privacy law, that is, the renowned CCPA. A significant difference compared to Brazilian and European laws is that American laws place a greater emphasis on corporate freedom, meaning there is a stronger focus on business interests than on individual rights.",
            "<strong>Australian Privacy Act</strong><br><br>Older than many, the Australian Privacy Act from 1988 imposes numerous amendments since its inception, making the interpretation and implementation somewhat complicated in a contemporary technical setting. The law was written at a time when hardly any ceasefire was attended to developing privacy concerns against digitalization, thus, requiring its constant modernizing all the way to this day by updates and amendments. The amendments are no less than one hundred and during the decades have found their ways into varied legislative updates, making the holistic investigation so an arduous task requiring diligent inquiry. ",
            "<strong>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</strong><br><br>As previously mentioned, the CCPA is a data protection law that predates the ADPPA, covering only the state of California. While it also has a similar focus on corporate freedom—as does its successor—it still has a more limited scope, applying only to specific organizations in California. It is important to be familiar with it, as, like the ADPPA, it does not have an explicit section on principles and can help in better understanding the scope and implicit principles.",
            "<strong>Privacy by Design (PbD)</strong><br><br>Proposed by Ann Cavoukian in 2009, stands out as all the principles of existing legislations—discussed globally—are correlated with the principles of PbD itself. Thus, it is based on seven fundamental principles, which are used globally and facilitate the application of privacy and data protection, especially during software design. In this way, these PbD schemes are often used in conjunction with local legislations, and moreover, some laws explicitly include PbD in their articles, such as the GDPR. This means that, in certain legislations, PbD is legally required to achieve compliance and, consequently, the privacy of personal data.",
            "<strong>ISO/IEC 29100</strong><br><br>In 2011, the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force established privacy principles that, like PbD, are directly related to the principles and legal bases of the privacy legislations. This means that, in addition to reinforcing the parameters of the law, the framework can complement guidelines that are abundant in one piece of legislation but scarce in another. Thus, ISO/IEC 29100—updated in 2020 for Brazilian standards—addresses principles based on the definition of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or merely Personal Data (DP), which refers to personal information capable of identifying an individual. Therefore, the scope covered by the framework is as comprehensive as the legislations, applying to natural persons or any organizations involved in the processing of personal data, ranging from specification to development and subsequent maintenance."
